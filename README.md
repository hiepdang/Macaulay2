This is a project in Macaulay2 followed the Schubert2 package,
Schubert3 package, and Singular library schubert.lib.

Goals: 

1. Add tools for computations in equivariant intersection theory. 
These tools are based on the localization theorem and Bott's formula.

2. Compute the Gromov-Witten invariants.
